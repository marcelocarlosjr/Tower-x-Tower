# Tower-x-Tower

Created for a University project for Game Development 1, Tower X Tower is a tower defense, rogue-like, dungeon crawler. You start as Brian, an engineer, whos been trapped in the dungeons of a never-ending tower. As a prisoner, he has learned to use scraps to his advantage to create different types of turrets with unique abilities. 

When you start, Brian can pick what turret he wants to wield to start his journey. He can also choose upgrades for these towers, that include: damage+, attack speed+, extra-shot, and bullet spread. Player upgrades such as: max-health+ and move-speed+ give the player options on how they want to build and choose how they will take on the tower and defeat the enemies.

At the end of each floor, Brian faces a much stronger opponent. Bosses have unique abilities that are designed to give the player a formidable battle. After you beat the final boss on the floor, the next tower level is unlocked where a new shop will randomly host towers and upgrades where the player can decide how to continue their run.
